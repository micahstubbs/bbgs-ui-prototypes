This example shows how to combine [d3-drag](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag) and [d3-zoom](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom) to allow dragging of individual circles within a zoomable canvas. If you click and drag on the background, the view pans; if you click and drag on a circle, it moves.

The tricky part of this example is the need to distinguish between two coordinate spaces: the world coordinates used to position the circles, and the pointer coordinates representing the mouse or touches. The drag behavior doesnâ€™t know the view is being transformed by the zoom behavior, so you must convert between the two coordinate spaces.

Compare this to the [simpler SVG implementation](/mbostock/3127661b6f13f9316be745e77fdfb084).
